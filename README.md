# My Python Project

This is a Python project that consists of the following files and directories:

- `src/main.py`: This file is the entry point of the application. It contains the main code for the Python project.
- `tests/test_main.py`: This file contains the unit tests for the `main.py` file. It ensures that the code in `main.py` functions correctly.
- `venv/`: This directory contains the virtual environment for the project. It is used to isolate the project's dependencies from the system's Python installation.
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control. It typically includes files such as the virtual environment and any sensitive or generated files.
- `setup.py`: This file is used to package the Python project for distribution. It contains metadata about the project and specifies the dependencies required to run the project.
